To start a new project:

1. Make a copy of the skeleton directory.

2. Rename(move) the NAME directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.

3. Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.

4. Rename test/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.

5. Double check it’s all working by using nosetests again.

6. Start coding.
