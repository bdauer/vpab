Current TODOs:

Make terminal interface fully functional.

Get lists (shopping and chore) working.

Get activity tracker working.

Set up a server with a database (use SQLAlchemy?) in order to store the lists and activities for remote access and eventual visualization.


Long term plan:


MODULES

1. Activity Tracker
2. Shopping List
3. Chore list
			(receive chores via sms or email)
			(send email or sms when criteria are met)
4. Schedule text message or phone call.
			
HIDDEN MODULES
1. send and receive email
2. send/receive sms
3. Events/conditions (if condition is met, then email/sms/alert/modify variable)
4. Visualize data.
5. List manager (prototype for shopping list, chores list)
6. Terminal interface
7. Some other interface for web app, tbd.


Possible later features (some of these, I can dream haha):

send commands via email or text
support for multiple users
